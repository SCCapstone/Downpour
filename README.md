# Project Name
Downpour
# Description
This is a language-learning Android app in a similar vein to Duolingo. Our app diverts from the traditional approach that apps
like Duolingo use by the languages on offer in our app. We are choosing to serve an underserved language group, that being the native languages of Pacific Islanders.
There are many different languages and groups in the Pacific so we are focusing on delivering an app that will allow the user to learn to read and speak the
Micronesian language of Pohnpeian. This app will teach and quiz users about the most used phrases that would give them a good working knowledge that would help users
get around the island and speak to natives.


following your instructions.
1. Install VScode and android stuio and create a virtual android device using the android studio emulator 
1. open the project in VScode and select your emulator device in the bottom right corner in the blue bar (make sure to install the dart and flutter extensions) 
1. Run the VScode debugger and your emulator device should launch with our app lauching aswell
## External Requirements

List all the stuff the reader will need to install in order to get you app to 
run in their laptop. For example:

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup

Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
database for running your webapp locally.

## Running

Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

Mobile apps will also sometimes need some instructions on how to build a
"release" version, maybe how to sign it, and how to run that binary in an
emulator or in a physical phone.

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run the automated tests.
